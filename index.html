It was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's on an island two kilometers into the sea and had the advantage of rock formations around it to give it natural protection. Apart from the beauty and historical value of this fort, the surrounding landscape in itself is a tourist’s delight with several options for adventure too.</p>

It is believed that the Vijaydurg Fort was built by Raja Bhoj II of Shilahar dynasty in 13th century CE. It was earlier known as Gheria because of its proximity to the village Girye and functioned as a strong military base for Admiral Kanhoji Angre, who had spread the terror in the minds of the enemies of that period. The fort is also known as the ‘Gibraltar of the East’ since it was so impregnable, surrounded by the Arabian Sea from three sides.</p>

As historical records show, the fort was known by different names at different times, including Tanas, Rasivata, Nandadeep and Rayari. It was initially under the control of Chandrarao More of Jawali and captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's when he defeated More in a fierce battle in 1656 CE, following which he re-named it Raigad. It was around this time that the boundaries of the Maratha Empire i.e. Swarajya were expanding and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's felt the need to shift the capital from Rajgad. </p>

With its hilly terrain and the ruler’s expertise at establishing forts at strategic points, the state can now lay claims to have some of the finest, strongest, and the most unique forts of India. Out of these, the ones at Lohagad and Visapur occupy an extremely important place in the history of Maratha rule for the various military activities that they witnessed.</p>

The fort, which is in the possession of Jalna Municipal Council, has been destroyed due to negligence. The office of the Municipal Council here has now been shifted to another place and this place has been abandoned. This part of the citadel is present on the banks of river Kundalika and is on the hummock of the city, a water supply tank has been constructed here. This fort was built by Nizam-ul-Mulk in the early 18th century in the city of Jalna, although today only the citadel remains. As this part is known as Mastgad, we come to this area but no one knows about the fort, so when we come here, we should inquire about the old office of the municipality.
